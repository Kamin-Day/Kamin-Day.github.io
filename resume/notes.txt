Kamin Day

Hey, _________
My name is Kamin and I would love to talk with you.


I'm web/applications developer with a knack for the creative side of things. I enjoy finding creative problems and devising creative solutions while I work to design and implement clean, well documented code. The joy for me comes creating something I can be proud of, knowing I covered every detail, and then presenting fully functional, testable, usable, and readable code to my teamates and clients so we can take things even further.

The world is filled with interesting things, and I enjoy learning about and experiencing as many of them from different perspectives as possible. As I experience new things, I find that there are many ways for them to be represented, whether it be through sound, color, emotion, and of course, with code. To be a part of an industry that allows my work to be a part of so many different things is the best part of what I do.

 I enjoy finding creative problems and devising creative solutions while I work to design and implement clean, well documented code. I find the joy for me comes through creating something I can be proud of. Knowing that every detail has been covered by taking the time to go back and make things just right is a key part of that process. 

 I am a quick learner, especially when things interest me. Currently, my experience lies mainly in HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM manipulation, SQL databases, and Ruby including the Rails and Sinatra Gems. I am familiar with several other technologies, and am currently working to advance my knowledge of C# and the .NET framework.
