Kamin Day

Hey, _________
My name is Kamin and I would love to talk with you.


I'm web/applications developer with a knack for the creative side of things. I enjoy finding creative problems and devising creative solutions while I work to design and implement clean, well documented code. The joy for me comes creating something I can be proud of, knowing I covered every detail, and then presenting fully functional, testable, usable, and readable code to my teamates and clients so we can take things even further.

The world is filled with interesting things, and I enjoy learning about and experiencing as many of them from different perspectives as possible. As I experience new things, I find that there are many ways for them to be represented, whether it be through sound, color, emotion, and of course, with code. To be a part of an industry that allows my work to be a part of so many different things is the best part of what I do.
