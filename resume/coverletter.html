					<h2> About me </h2>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Who am I?</h3>
							<p>My name is Kamin, and I am a web/applications developer from Omaha. I have a knack for the creative side of things, and to me, the world is filled with interesting things. I enjoy learning about and experiencing as many of those things from different perspectives as possible. As I experience new things, I find that there are many ways for them to be represented, whether it be through sound, color, emotion, and of course, with code. To be a part of an industry that allows my work to be a part of so many different things is the best part of what I do.
							</p></li>
						<li><h3>What I do..</h3>
							<p>  I enjoy finding creative problems and devising creative solutions while I work to design and implement clean, well documented code. I find the joy for me comes through creating something I can be proud of. Knowing that every detail has been covered by taking the time to go back and make things just right is a key part of that process. I like working with others and a continued learning and sharing of knowledge is important to me. </p>
  
        					<p> I am a quick learner, especially when things interest me. Currently, my experience lies mainly in HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM manipulation, SQL databases, and Ruby including the Rails and Sinatra Gems. I am familiar with several other technologies, and am currently working to advance my knowledge of C# and the .NET framework.

					<h2> Why you have my interest</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Who are you?</h3>
							<p>These days, I like to call myself a developer, but that wasn't always the case. Having done lots of dirty jobs in the past, from pouring concrete in the summers to building roofs in the midst of frigid South Dakota ice rains, I've learned just how important it is to have the tools, teamwork, and knowledge you need to get things done well and make it home in time for dinner.....
							</p></li>
						<li><h3>Why am I interested?</h3>
							<p> Well, you see, I have a lot to learn, but thats not something thats going to stop me from growing and becoming a valuable team member no matter where I go.

				<h2> My Work</h2>
				<h3 class="underline_text"> Film Streams Student Night Application</h3>
				<p> Updated a data & attendance tracking application for the Film Streams' organization to include additional data and functionality, including the ability to clean and modify information and export information into different formats. Added functionality to allow the application to effectively work for multiple locations upon the opening of Film Streams' second location, and provided views for new types of data.</p>
