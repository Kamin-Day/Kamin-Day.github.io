						<h2> About me </h2>
						<ul>
							<li><h3>Who am I?</h3>
								<p>My name is Kamin, and I am a web/applications developer from Omaha. I have a knack for the creative side of things, and to me, the world is filled with interesting things. I enjoy learning about and experiencing as many of them from different perspectives as possible. I enjoy seeing things represented in various forms, whether that be sound, color, or code. To be a part of an industry that allows my work to be a part of so many different things is the best part of what I do. I have lots of hobbies, and I'll talk with you about anything.
								</p></li>
							<li><h3>What I do..</h3>
								<p>  I enjoy finding creative problems and devising creative solutions while I work to design and implement clean, well documented code. My drive is fueled by interest, caring, and a passion for good work. As I would avoid wasting a material resource, I avoid wasting a fragment of code. To me, the world of code is a place to stay clean, organized, and efficient through my understanding of ongoing and expanding goals .I find the joy for me comes through creating something I can be proud of. Knowing that every detail has been covered by taking the time to go back and make things just right is a key part of that process. I like working with others and a continued learning and sharing of knowledge is important to me. </p>
	  
	        					<p> I am a quick learner, especially when things interest me. Currently, my experience lies mainly in HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM manipulation, SQL databases, and Ruby including the Rails and Sinatra Gems. I am familiar with several other technologies, and am currently working to advance my knowledge of C# and the .NET framework.

						<h2> Why you have my interest</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><h3>Who are you?</h3>
								<p> You are LovelySkin. You are a collection of professionals, innovaters, and hardworkers. You are a respected medical and research facility, that has become one of the worlds largest online cosmetics and skin care retailers through perseverance, hardwork, and continued development. Your a group that works together and has a good time at it, and you just keep going.


								</p></li>
							<li><h3>Why am I interested?</h3>
								<p> For obvious reasons. After taking a short tour of your facility and development area, I couldn't help but fall in love with the atmosphere. With so much natural light, the wide open spaces, and clean and professional feel, a developer couldn't ask for a better place to be productive and feel good while doing it.</p>

								<p>Then, in your beautiful conference room during our conversation with some of the team members there at LovelySkin, my intrigue really started to build. With so many years of development already, and the ongoing strive from within your company, the chance to work with and develop in-house softwares and other tools is fascinating opportunity that I would love to be a part of. I had a great time talking with some of the team and loved to hear about what they had to say as far as how things work there and how it all became to be. </p>

								<p> C# and the .NET framework are topics I am eager to dive into and learn. Being able to do so in a fast pased, collaborative environment would be an incredible opportunity and wonderful experience to grow with. I loved to hear of so many other Omaha Code School students happily growing to be a part of your team under your roof.</p>

				"Kamin is uncommonly kind and studious. While working with him on various web development projects, I was always impressed by how comfortable he grew with unfamiliar code. He makes all the right assumptions about how a system is tied together, and he reads docs meticulously to gain a better understanding. His productivity on a web application backend is astounding, especially when dealing with SQL and model-layer functionality. He's also a pleasure to work with."  -  Sumeet Jain
